# Solar Panel Surface Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to classify various surface conditions of solar panels using deep learning models. The models are trained to identify and classify different states such as clean, dusty, bird-dropped, electrical damage, physical damage, and snow-covered surfaces on solar panels.

## Models and Results
The project experimented with three different deep learning architectures:
- DenseNet121
- EfficientNetB0
- VGG

Each model was trained and evaluated on the dataset, achieving the following results:
## -  DenseNet121:
